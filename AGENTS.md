# AGENTS.md

This repository follows the Grimoire protocol. Read `FAMILIAR.md` for the full project-context rules.

This repo is **both** the live sneaker.games website **and** the architecture repository for project `sneaker-games-site`. Durable architecture lives here. Related implementation and asset vaults (`extra_sources`) are separate repos; copy built bundles into this tree. Do not treat those vaults as separate products of this project, and do not clone them unless the current work actually needs their source.

Before work:

1. Read `architecture/`.
2. Read `activity/CURRENT.md`.
3. Read the three most recent dated files in `activity/`.

Authority is split by information type:

- `architecture/` is canonical for durable intent, constraints, structure, and deliberately promoted design decisions.
- `activity/CURRENT.md` is authoritative for current execution state and the single next action.
- dated `activity/` records are evidence and history.
- this file and `FAMILIAR.md` define how to interpret and operate the repository; do not duplicate the active-work pointer here.

Surface contradictions rather than silently resolving them.

Before ending substantial work, follow the canonical Grimoire `prompts/session-close.md` or its derived `endsession` skill. Activity records use `activity/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` and `activity/SESSION-TEMPLATE.md`.

Propose architecture changes in activity; do not promote them automatically.

**Preserve activity freely. Promote architecture deliberately.**
